# Safety Rules

## Read-only first

The operator must inspect, summarize, plan, and generate prompts before it is allowed to mutate anything.

## Always blocked in Phase 0

- Merge PRs.
- Push code.
- Delete branches.
- Deploy production changes.
- Send customer messages.
- Expose secrets.
- Change credentials.
- Execute trades.
- Make paid API calls without explicit approval.
- Perform destructive file operations.
- Register live Telegram commands.
- Scrape Codex usage.

## Approval rules for future phases

Future write actions require:

- explicit user approval
- clear command name
- clear target project
- clear intended change
- documented danger level
- audit trail

## Financial and trading boundary

SPY Market Agent may support research, summaries, simulation, and backtesting. It must not execute trades or connect to brokerage execution without a separate approved safety design.

## Customer communication boundary

The operator may draft messages in future phases. It must not send customer, staff, or public messages automatically in early phases.

## Paid API boundary

Any paid API call must require explicit approval unless a future budget and allowlist are documented.

# Local Operator Simulator

This folder contains the Phase 1 local-only command simulator for Personal Project Operator.

It lets you test phone-style command outputs before OpenClaw routes real chat messages.

## What it supports

```bash
node local-operator/simulate-command.mjs /status
node local-operator/simulate-command.mjs /menu
node local-operator/simulate-command.mjs /menu project
node local-operator/simulate-command.mjs /menu codex
node local-operator/simulate-command.mjs /menu system
node local-operator/simulate-command.mjs /help
```

## Files

- `project-state.json`: local mock project state for current and placeholder projects.
- `commands.json`: local command catalog and menu grouping.
- `simulate-command.mjs`: dependency-free Node.js ESM simulator.

## Requirements

- Node.js installed locally.
- No npm install required.
- No OpenClaw dependency is installed in this repo.

OpenClaw should be installed separately during local testing.

## Safety boundary

The simulator is local-only and read-only.

It does not:

- call GitHub APIs
- call Telegram APIs
- scrape Codex usage
- deploy to a VPS
- store secrets
- write to external systems

## OpenClaw handoff shape

Future OpenClaw routing can treat this simulator as the command behavior reference:

```text
incoming chat text -> command parser -> local operator command handler -> phone-style response
```

Phase 1 proves the command output shape only. Live integrations belong to later phases.
